# EndPoint
This is tool that allows for fetching information about a minecraft java server with just a server ip address. (This does NOT allow you
to find servers and isn't a tool for server finding. You need the server's ip first) 

# How to use?
Using is pretty easy, you need python of course. It is recommended to do pip install -r requirements.txt
to intsall the libs that this script needs. The installer will also just do it for you if you toggle
a box. (Respects venvs). You NEED wxPython or even the installer won't work, it is for the gui.

# What python version?
I wrote this in python 3.11.2 and i'm not sure what version is needed but 
I assume 3.0 or greater will work.

# MOTD
EndPoint will give you the MOTD of the server once a ip is submitted. It also formats it to be readable. (I will eventully add a way to view raw MOTD)
it will also color it.

# Version
Self explanitory, It will display the version(s) the server reported and the protocol version.

# Error reporting
It will tell you the errors under the Input Server portion once they occur.

# Ending stuff
This program isn't complete and I still have things to add. It is open source and if you plan to include it in
one of your projects please credit and list this repo. Same with if you fork it (Also please think about starring)

Thank you for checking out this repo, this is one of my first projects and i'm doing it to have fun and learn
more about GUI dev
