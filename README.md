# EndPoint
This is tool that allows for fetching information about a minecraft java server with just a server ip address. (This does NOT allow you
to find servers and isn't a tool for server finding. You need the server's ip first) 

# How to use?
Using is pretty easy, you need python of course. It is recommended to do pip install -r requirements.txt
to intsall the libs that this script needs. The installer will also just do it for you if you toggle
a box. (Respects venvs). You NEED wxPython or even the installer won't work, it is for the gui.

# What python version?
I wrote this in python 3.11.2 and i'm not sure what version is needed but 
I assume 3.0 or greater will work.

# MOTD
EndPoint will give you the MOTD of the server once a ip is submitted. It also formats it to be readable. (I will eventully add a way to view raw MOTD)
it will also color it. (Broke somehow, I will fix it eventully)

# Version
Self explanitory, It will display the version(s) the server reported and the protocol version.

# Error reporting
It will tell you the errors under the Input Server portion once they occur.

# Extra Info
This program is under development and I am doing it for fun so it may randomly not recieve updates
for awhile so don't expect them to be constant
